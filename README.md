# JeChain
A simple PoW blockchain.

## What is JeChain?
JeChain is a proof-of-work blockchain created using Javascript, originally used in [this series on dev.to](https://dev.to/freakcdev297/series/15322).

## Why JeChain?
JeChain was created for educational purposes, also as an attempt trying to create a full-blown blockchain network.

## Should you use JeChain?
No, it's more of a proof-of-concept, not a production-ready chain, so no.
