# JeChain
A simple PoW blockchain.

## What is JeChain?
JeChain is a proof-of-work blockchain created using Javascript, originally used in [this series on dev.to](https://dev.to/freakcdev297/series/15322). If you are here for that, consider checking out [this repo](https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/blockchain-tutorial/tree/main/Creating%20a%20blockchain%20in%2060%20lines%20of%20Javascript).

## Why JeChain?
JeChain was created for educational purposes, also as an attempt trying to create a full-blown blockchain network.

## Should you use JeChain?
No, it's more of a proof-of-concept, not a production-ready chain, so no.
